# canlogger

##Specification:
Develop C++ application for mining loader's on-board computer.  
On-board computer is ARM-based embedded PC running Linux, it have WLAN adapter and CAN connection to loader's ECU.  

##Signals are engine and hydraulics measurements:
Engine RPM  
Engine Coolant temperature  
Engine Oil Temperature  
Engine Oil Pressure  
Hydraulic Oil Temperature  
Hydraulic Oil Pressure  
##Data is production measurements:
Scoop bucket load weight  
Bucket dump timestamp  

Signals and data should be collected by application and stored in SQLite database.  
Trigger for data upload is configured minimal size of data packet and WLAN availability.  
Data is transmitted over UDP socket to logging server from which it is sent over https to cloud-based backend application.  

ECU mock will be sending randomly changing values with configured period over vcan interface.  
Production data is generated by mock of bucket scales - it will send weight of unloaded rock at random intervals over CAN.  

##vcan setup:
`sudo modprobe vcan`
`sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan`
`sudo ifconfig vcan0 up`

can_logger application is mocking on-board computer app, it uses sqlite in-memory database for signals buffering.  
##install sqlite:
`sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev`

##install FastDDS locally:
Process is complicated, proceed per FastDDS documentation

##build:
cmake .
make

run:
in one terminal - ./ecu_mock  
in another terminal - ./scales_mock  
in yet another terminal - ./can_logger (you may need to do "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/Fast-DDS/install/lib" once in this terminal)  

can_logger will print received measurements.  
If there is DDS subscriber to CanLoggerTopic then it will print "Sending data.." every 100 measurements.  
DDS publisher not fully functional, only some messages will arrive to subscriber. DDS subscriber not included in this repository.
